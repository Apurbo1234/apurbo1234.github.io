     <p class="pop">Myself Apurbo. So, I am just like any other boy you would know raised in a well behaved family As a kid my life was not all that glorius we lived In a joint family.so I used to be in a English medium school named MEMS,and that school gave so much experience of co-curricular activites.
     <br>
     <br>
     So,yeah I spend lots of my favourite time in that school.I left that school at class:6 because of family crisis and got shifted with our aunt at Faridabad and also got admitted to a Bangla medium school.also I lost my father at a young age .so it was so hardshipping for me .
     <br>
     <br>
     So,as I was an english medium student I had to through hardest time in my life.since i was poor in bangla  .I had so much trouble settling in that position.but i managed somehow.so things got smoothly after.and after few days I started showng interest in web development.As,my uncle was a software engineer.so I had a backup support there .I had so much fun gaining this experience and it was a whole new world for me where I was a newbie.so yeah I am on my path of life.Make sure to enjoy life.<br>

     <div class="pp2"><h1>Thoughts of future</h1>
     </div>
     <p>So let the past fade away.Time to concentrate on future.Present is the time where you sow your seed for the fruit you are going to devour in future.so make sure to take care of the seed or who knows the seed you planted in present day might get rotten in future.so make sure to take care of the seed you sowed
     <br>
     <br>
     Passion,Hard-work and will power these simple three things is all you need for future like no other.Remember,the moment you give up on your dream is the moment you stopped your life.stand up and don't ever loose control on your feet things might get faded sometimes but that doesn't mean you stop living.you still have the soul.
     <br>
     <br>
     Life is just a journey and future is your destination.on your way you meet so many types of people holding on their behaviour.You might get fraustrated sometimes for making decisions.but decision is just the either way never regret your decisions.Have faith in yourself.Ofcourse that's how life Is!
     <br>
      <br>
       I dropped myself countless times in my life .but that doesn't mean i am dead already.i lost many hopes and peoples.but i made sure to create new ones,if i don't create myself what i am called for?.So make sure to never give.Fight will all you've got.you will not get dissapointment
       <br>
       <br>
       So, Right now i am also fighting myself to get over these things.Create a passion.Doing hardworks.having the will power .Yes,I am Enjoying myself
